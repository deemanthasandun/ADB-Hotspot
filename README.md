# ADB-Hotspot

This simple batch script automates the process of connecting to an Android device over a mobile hotspot using ADB. No need to manually find the device's IP address or run commands â€“ just run the script.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get the script up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You need to have the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) installed on your computer. Ensure that you have the `adb.exe` file in the same directory as this script.

### Usage

1. Make sure your Android device is set up as a mobile hotspot.

2. Download the `connect_adb_hotspot.bat` script from this repository and place it in the same folder as your `adb.exe` file.

3. Run the script by double-clicking it or executing it from the command line.

4. The script will automatically connect to your Android device over the default mobile hotspot IP address and ADB port.
